The pems module contains all functions for downloading files from the PEMS site. Make a python script in this directory called ```creds.py``` with variables "username" and "password" to store your login credentials.

The notebook ```data_pkl_to_csv.ipynb``` converts all processed data as pickle files to csvs.

The notebooks ```station_data_extractor.ipynb``` and ```station_meta_extractor.ipynb``` lightly process and load the PEMS data into pickle files for further processing and EDA.
